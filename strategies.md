Here are specific, concrete-to-abstract strategies for each operation. Addition strategies 

- Counting On (Representational): 
For problems like \(8+3\), teach students to start with the larger number (8) and count up. They can use fingers or a number line to jump forward. This is more efficient than counting every number from one.
- Make Ten (Representational/Abstract): This strategy helps students see number relationships, which is a key to mental math.Example: For \(8+5\), a student can recognize that \(8+2\) makes 10. They can break the 5 into 2 and 3, solve \(8+2=10\), and then add the remaining 3 to get 13.
- Visual Aid: Ten frames with counters are an excellent tool to demonstrate this visually.Doubles and Near Doubles (Abstract): If a student knows that \(7+7=14\), they can use this known fact to solve related problems.Example: For \(7+8\), they can think, "\(7+7=14\), and one more is 15." Subtraction strategies Counting Back (Representational): Similar to counting on, students can start with the larger number and count backwards. A number line is the ideal tool for visualizing this process.Counting Up to Subtract (Representational): For problems like \(12-9\), students can start at 9 and count up to 12. Using their fingers or jumps on a number line, they find the "difference" is 3.Fact Families (Abstract): Teach addition and subtraction as related operations. If a student knows \(8+4=12\), they automatically know that \(12-8=4\) and \(12-4=8\). Using manipulatives to build a visual model of the fact family can solidify this connection. Multiplication strategies Repeated Addition (Representational/Abstract): Introduce multiplication as a form of repeated addition.Example: To solve \(4\times 3\), a student can add \(3+3+3+3\).Visual Aid: Manipulatives like blocks or counters can be arranged into equal groups to show that four groups of three is 12.Arrays and Area Models (Concrete/Representational): Use grid paper or tiles to build arrays (rows and columns).Example: For \(3\times 4\), a student can create an array of 3 rows with 4 columns. This visually shows the product is 12.Application: The area model is especially effective for demonstrating the commutative property (\(3\times 4=4\times 3\)), showing that the total area remains the same even if the rectangle is rotated.Skip Counting (Abstract): Use skip counting (e.g., counting by 2s, 5s, or 10s) to demonstrate multiplication patterns. This connects to repeated addition and helps with mental math. Division strategies Equal Groups (Concrete/Representational): Connect division to the idea of "fair sharing".Example: For \(12\div 3\), have a student divide 12 counters into 3 equal groups. They will see that each group has 4 counters.Visual Aid: Draw circles or other simple shapes to represent the groups.Repeated Subtraction (Representational/Abstract): Show division as the inverse of multiplication, where a number is repeatedly subtracted until zero is reached.Example: For \(12\div 3\), a student can subtract 3 four times (\(12-3=9\), \(9-3=6\), \(6-3=3\), \(3-3=0\)).Fact Families (Abstract): Once multiplication is understood, reinforce the inverse relationship with division. The same fact family used for addition and subtraction can be extended. For example, if a student knows \(3\times 4=12\), they know that \(12\div 4=3\) and \(12\div 3=4\).
